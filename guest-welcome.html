							&nbsp;<br/>We are grateful to have you as a guest on BizDayGlobal! We strive to make our guests look good. To that end, please read through the following guidelines and let us know if you have questions.
							<ul>
								<li>First question: We will ask you to give our audience your "elevator pitch". <br/>&nbsp;</br></li>

								<li>Since BizDayGlobal is here to make you look good, we will not push into areas that you want to avoid. For example, if we ask a question about an unannounced project, just say "we're not ready to discuss that yet" and our interviewer will gladly move on.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>We are not trying to catch you with <i>gotcha</i> questions; we want you to look good in front of the audience!<br/>&nbsp;</br></li>

								<li>Subsequent questions will key off your responses to our earlier questions. We will also refer to the information on your web site, LinkedIn profile, and other publicly available info about you and your company.<br/>&nbsp;<br/></li>
								<li>Wear solid colors- Just like in TV news, it's always best to wear solid colors.<br/>&nbsp;</br></li>
 
								<li>Make eye contact- Position your computer or phone at eye level and look at your host or directly into the camera. When in doubt, look into the camera.<br/>&nbsp;</br></li>
									 
								<li>Keep water nearby- To avoid interruptions, always keep a glass of water nearby in case you need to hydrate mid-interview.<br/>&nbsp;</br></li>
									 
								<li>Arrive early- Join the stream 5-10 minutes early for testing.<br/>&nbsp;</br></li>
									 
								<li>Setup with plenty of light on your face- use natural light if possible.<br/>&nbsp;</br></li>
									 
								<li>Keep your head center framed, with a small amount of room between the top of your head, and the top of the frame.<br/>&nbsp;</br></li>
									 
								<li>Stay close to the computer so we can hear you â€“ the distance you need to type comfortably at the keyboard is perfect.<br/>&nbsp;</br></li>
							</ul>

							&nbsp;<br/>We are grateful to have you as a guest on BizDayGlobal! We strive to make our guests look good. To that end, please read through the following guidelines and let us know if you have questions.
							<ul>
								<li>Interviews are conducted via <a href="https://zoom.us">Zoom</a>. Do you want a custom background to appear behind you during the interview?<br/>&nbsp;</br></li>
 
								<li>If you can, hardwire your computer into the ethernet port on your router.<br/>&nbsp;</br></li>
									 
								<li>Close all browser windows, and limit any unnecessary bandwidth usage on your network (streaming, downloads, etc).<br/>&nbsp;</br></li>
									 
								<li>Use Google Chrome if possible for a stronger, faster connection.<br/>&nbsp;</br></li>
									 
								<li>Unless you have a studio-quality microphone, we recommend using a headset with a microphone if possible.<br/>&nbsp;</br></li>
									 
								<li>Make sure your camera and mic are open when you join.<br/>&nbsp;</br></li>
									 
								<li>Eliminate background noise- ensure phone and chat services are muted.<br/>&nbsp;</br></li>
